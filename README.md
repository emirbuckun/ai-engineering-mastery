# ai-engineering-mastery

A comprehensive collection of Python implementations and projects developed during the **AI Engineer Professional Certificate**. This repository tracks my journey through advanced Deep Learning architectures, Large Language Model (LLM) orchestration, and the operationalization of machine learning models (MLOps).

## 🚀 Overview
This track covers the full spectrum of a modern AI Engineer's toolkit—from fine-tuning hyperparameters to deploying containerized agents.

* **Deep Learning:** CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, and GRUs.
* **Modern NLP:** Attention Mechanisms, Transformers (BERT, GPT), and Fine-tuning.
* **AI Agents:** Multi-agent systems using AutoGen, CrewAI, and LangGraph.
* **MLOps:** Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines, and Model Versioning.
